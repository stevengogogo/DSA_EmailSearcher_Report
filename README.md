# ReportTeX: A LaTeX template supporting both English and Traditional Chinese

[![.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/stevengogogo/ReportTex/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/stevengogogo/ReportTex/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


**ReportTeX** is a LaTeX pipeline for generating reports and manuscripts. This template uses [tectonic](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic) engine to avoid cumbersome installation of MacTex (just try `brew install tectonic` :) ), and this is an big life-saver ! 

This pipeline also supports Chinese characters, which are difficult to render with the TeX engine. Fourtunely, `tectonic` is based on XeTeX which supports `UTF8` characters. The sample below is the output of a mixture of English and Manderin words:

Besides, this CI provides early bug detection and helps you to fix `tex` file during composition. To my knowlege, this is the easist pipeline to work on Latex with Manderin article. EnjoyðŸ˜„.
